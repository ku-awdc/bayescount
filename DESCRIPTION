Description:
    A set of functions and interactive Shiny apps to allow analysis of
    over-dispersed count data such as that associated with egg reduction rate
    (ERR) and faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) studies in parasitology.
    Functions and apps are also provided to assist in sample size calculations
    for future studies.  A working installation of JAGS is required for
    MCMC-based methods (see <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net>).
